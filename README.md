# **Machine Learning Course Projects - Bioinformatics Institute 2024**

Welcome to the repository for Machine Learning Course Projects at the Bioinformatics Institute 2024!

## **Project 8: Convolutional Neural Networks**

[Project 8](08_cnn) explores `Convolutional Neural Networks` (CNNs), featuring a custom convolution function and a replication of the AlexNet architecture. The model includes five convolutional layers with 2D max pooling for feature extraction and fully connected layers for classification, all utilizing the `ReLU` activation function. Experiments were conducted using the `PyTorch` library.

## **Project 7: Multilayer Perceptron**

[Project 7](07_neural_networks) involves building a `Multilayer Perceptron` (MLP) with three fully connected layers, exploring different activation functions and optimizers for performance improvements.

## **Project 5: Ensemble Methods**

[Project 5](05_ensembles) dives into Ensemble Learning, implementing algorithms such as `Random Forests`, and `CatBoost`, along with custom functions for `Random Forest` classification.

## **Project 4: Decision Trees**

[Project 4](04_decision_trees) focuses on implementing a `Decision Tree` to classify music genres based on pre-extracted song features such as danceability, energy, and loudness. The project includes data preprocessing, model tuning with `GridSearchCV`, and performance evaluation using metrics like accuracy and precision.

## **Project 3: Clustering & t-SNE**

[Project 3](03_unsupervised_learning) explores Clustering Algorithms, including `KMeans`, `Agglomerative Clustering`, and `DBSCAN`, with custom `KMeans` implementations.

## **Project 2: Linear Regression**

[Project 2](02_Linear_models) focuses on Linear Regression, incorporating gradient descent for both regression and binary classification, along with tools for data analysis like `VIF` and `QQ` plots.

## **Project 1: k-Nearest Neighbors**

[Project 1](01_kNN) covers the implementation of the `k-Nearest Neighbors` (k-NN) algorithm from scratch, with comparisons to existing implementations.
