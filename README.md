# **Machine Learning Course Projects - Bioinformatics Institute 2024**

Welcome to the repository for Machine Learning Course Projects at the Bioinformatics Institute 2024!

## **Project 8: Convolutional Neural Networks**

Project 7 explores Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), featuring a custom convolution function and a replication of the AlexNet architecture. The model includes five convolutional layers with 2D max pooling for feature extraction and fully connected layers for classification, all utilizing the ReLU activation function. Experiments were conducted using the PyTorch library.

## **Project 7: Multilayer Perceptron**

Project 6 involves building a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) with three fully connected layers, exploring different activation functions and optimizers for performance improvements.

## **Project 5: Ensemble Methods**

Project 5 dives into Ensemble Learning, implementing algorithms such as Random Forests, and CatBoost, along with custom functions for Random Forest classification.

## **Project 4: Decision Trees**

Project 4 focuses on implementing a Decision Tree to classify music genres based on pre-extracted song features such as danceability, energy, and loudness. The project includes data preprocessing, model tuning with `GridSearchCV`, and performance evaluation using metrics like accuracy and precision.

## **Project 3: Clustering & t-SNE**

Project 3 explores Clustering Algorithms, including KMeans, Agglomerative Clustering, and DBSCAN, with custom KMeans implementations.

## **Project 2: Linear Regression**

Project 2 focuses on Linear Regression, incorporating gradient descent for both regression and binary classification, along with tools for data analysis like VIF and QQ plots.

## **Project 1: k-Nearest Neighbors**

Project 1 covers the implementation of the k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm from scratch, with comparisons to existing implementations.
